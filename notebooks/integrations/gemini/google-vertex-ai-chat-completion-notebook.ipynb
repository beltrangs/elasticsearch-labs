            "    *   **E**lasticsearch: This is the heart of the stack. It's a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. It's designed for high scalability and can index and search massive volumes of data quickly. It's excellent for full-text search, structured search, analytics, and time-series data.\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **L**ogstash: This is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a \"stash\" like Elasticsearch. It's used for collecting, parsing, and enriching logs and other event data.\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **K**ibana: This is a powerful open-source data visualization and management tool for Elasticsearch. It provides a user interface to explore, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can create dashboards, charts, and reports to gain insights.\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Beats:** These are lightweight, single-purpose data shippers that send data from hundreds or thousands of machines to Logstash or Elasticsearch. Examples include Filebeat (for log files), Metricbeat (for system metrics), Winlogbeat (for Windows event logs), and Packetbeat (for network data). They are designed to be resource-efficient and easy to deploy.\n",
